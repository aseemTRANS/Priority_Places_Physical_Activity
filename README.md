# Priority_Places_Physical_Activity

### Aim
Identify and rank Leeds locations that, with thoughtful improvements, might serve as hubs for promoting active lifestyles among all demographic groups.

### Data Description
- We've meticulously categorized our variables into four distinct domains: Environment, Socio-economic, Health, and Physical Infrastructure. Each of these domains is critical to understanding the complex interplay between urban living conditions and public health.

- Starting with the Environment, we've included an air quality index —crucial indicators of the air we breathe. Crime rate is our next measure, providing a per-thousand-person metric of violent crime, a statistic that influences both the perception and reality of safety in our neighborhoods.

- In the Socio-economic domain, we consider the income score from 2019, reflecting the deprivation levels within our community. Work time gives us insight into labor patterns, measuring the average working hours for full-time employment.

- Moving on to Health, we've addressed the disability rate as defined under the Equality Act, which is instrumental in understanding the challenges faced by our disabled population. Additionally, we've evaluated the healthcare facility coverage rate, highlighting the percentage of areas within a 1,000-meter radius of essential healthcare services.

- The Physical Infrastructure domain perhaps most vividly illustrates the practical aspects of our daily lives. Here we include the walkability score, a normalized measure considering the distance to gardens, bus stop counts, and footway lengths. This score is pivotal in understanding the ease of pedestrian access across our community. Similarly, the walkable bus stop count offers a snapshot of public transport accessibility within an 800-meter, or roughly 20-minute walk, radius.

- Lastly, the number of sports facilities speaks to the recreational infrastructure available to our community, encompassing everything from golf courses to swimming pools, emphasizing the importance of physical activity in our daily lives.

Each variable, sourced from respected databases like the Consumer Research Data Centre, Leeds Observatory, and the Office for National Statistics, provides a lens through which we can view and assess the quality of life in Leeds. The integration of Open Street Map data further ensures that our geographical analyses are grounded in the most accurate and up-to-date cartographic information.

### Approach
- We started by identifying suitable variables for a Physical Activity Priority Index and then carefully weighted these variables. 
- We merged data from various sources, aligned indicators to ensure comparability, standardized rankings, and ultimately visualized our findings on a multi-domain map to provide a clear visual representation of priority areas.

### Results
- The first domain is Environment, which we weighted the largest among all domains. The map here presents priority places for the environment domain, which comprises the crime rate and the air quality. The darker colour indicates higher priority, and the lighter indicates lower priority. 
- The LSOAs in the south-west of Leeds have higher priority. This is mainly because of the extremely high crime rates in the city centre and poor air quality in the areas where arterial roads stretch toward other major cities and industries are concentrated.
- The second largest weight was given to the Physical infrastructure domain. The fringe of Leeds exhibits higher priority.
- This can be attributed to the longer distance to the nearest garden space in the northern-east fringe, the smaller number of walkable distant bus stops in the suburbs and the skewed distribution of sports facilities in the suburban areas.
- The third one is the Health domain. Similarly, the high priority was observed in the outskirt areas. This was contributed by the higher rate of the disabled in certain residential areas and poorer coverage of healthcare facilities in the Outer areas.
- The last domain is socio-economic. The LSOA surrounding the city centre exhibit the highest priority. This is because the low-income LSOAs concentrate in these areas and those who are in the outskirts of Leeds tend to work longer.
